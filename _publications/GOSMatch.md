## Abstract

Detecting loop closures in 3D Light Detection andRanging  (LiDAR)  data  is  a  challenging  task  since  point-levelmethods  always  suffer  from  instability.  This  paper  presents  asemantic-level approach named GOSMatch to perform reliableplace   recognition.   Our   method   leverages   novel   descriptors,which  are  generated  from  the  spatial  relationship  betweensemantics,  to  perform  frame  description  and  data  association.We also propose a coarse-to-fine strategy to efficiently search forloop closures. Besides, GOSMatch can give an accurate 6-DOFinitial pose estimation once a loop closure is confirmed. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the KITTI odometrydataset and the results show that GOSMatch can achieve robustloop  closure  detection  performance  and  outperform  existingmethods.
